## Introduction

This project focuses on developing a prediction-based portfolio optimization system for commercial banks in Nepal. By combining LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and the mean variance model, we aim to address the challenges faced by banks in managing their portfolios effectively. The choice of this theme is driven by the need for innovative tools that can optimize asset allocation while considering risk and return objectives. Traditional methods may not capture the complexities of market dynamics, making it necessary to explore advanced techniques.

The project's objectives are to create a prediction model using LSTM to forecast future stock prices and integrate these predictions into the mean variance model for portfolio optimization. The scope of our work focuses specifically on the commercial banks in Nepal, tailoring the prediction -based portfolio optimization system to their unique needs and market conditions. The system utilizes historical data of stocks from the commercial banks' asset inputs and incorporates a risk model specific to the Nepalese banking industry.

The report includes a literature review, discussing existing portfolio optimization models, and presents our methodology, results, and findings. We also discuss the implications and potential applications of our project within the Nepalese banking industry.

Overall, this project aims to provide a valuable tool for commercial banks in Nepal to optimize their asset allocation and make informed investment decisions. By leveraging predictive modeling and portfolio optimization techniques, our system offers a practical solution to address the specific challenges faced by banks in managing their portfolios effectively. Additionally, by utilizing LSTM for predicting future stock prices and integrating it with the mean variance model, our system aims to enhance portfolio performance and align it with the risk and return objectives of commercial banks in Nepal. This project contributes to the advancement of portfolio management practices in the context of the Nepalese banking industry, offering a valuable tool for inf ormed decision-making and optimized asset allocation.

## Implementation : 
Implementation of the "Prediction based Portfolio Optimization using LSTM and Mean Variance Optimization Model" system involved the use of various libraries and technologies. The backend was developed using Node.js, while the LSTM algorithm and optimization model were implemented using TensorFlow and Pandas libraries. Flask was used to control the LSTM algorithm and handle the optimization process.

The frontend of the system was built using React, with Material UI for designing the user interface. The combination of React and Material UI provided a seamless and visually appealing user experience. During the implementation phase, several critical code components were developed. For example, the code for handling user registration and login was implemented using Node.js and integrated with the user database. The LSTM algorithm was implemented in Python using TensorFlow, allowing for the prediction of future stock prices based on historical data. The mean variance optimization model was implemented using Pandas, allowing for the calculation of optimal portfolio weights.

Throughout the implementation, various challenges were encountered and addressed. These included difficulties in working with complex existing software, such as TensorFlow, which required careful documentation referencing and thorough understanding. Additionally, the ambitious aims of the project necessitated careful planning and management of resources to ensure successful implementation.

Overall, the implementation phase involved the realization of the system's key concepts and ideas. While not all code components are described in detail in this section, the critical pieces that drive the system's functionality are highlighted, providing insight into the system's operation.




# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
